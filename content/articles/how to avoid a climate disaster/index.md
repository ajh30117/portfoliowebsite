Bill Gates’ *How to Avoid a Climate Disaster: The Solutions We Have and the Breakthroughs We Need* is an engaging and readable introduction to the world’s climate crisis and the ways we can address it. 

The book is digestible and breaks down seriously complex topics using percentages, analogies, and plain language. Readers with little-to-no prior understanding of the climate crisis are able to get a clear and functional grip on what the crisis is, what’s causing it, and how we can solve it (if we really try).

My only minor criticism is that the book becomes harder to read as it goes on, and the information in the final couple chapters is a little repetitive.

A lot of attention was clearly paid to keeping the language about science and technology (in the first few chapters) simple and lucid, but it seems like less attention was paid to describing politics and markets in the same way (in the final chapters).

Even so, the book is accessible, enlightening, and up-to-date — a useful introduction to the earth’s intensifying climate disaster.

Here are 8 important takeaways:

## 1. Transitioning from dependence on fossil fuels to clean energy will be difficult 
   Why? 

Because (1) we’ve spent decades building up extensive and costly fossil fuel infrastructure, (2) there are expensive “Green Premiums” added costs of using clean energy, (3) lack of incentives for companies to invest in clean energy, (4) lack of consensus on local, national, and international levels.

## 2. To make a big impact, we need big systemic changes

For example, changes to energy infrastructure, R&D funding for clean energy, market incentives to invest in and use clean energy, and policies and regulations in favor of clean energy use. And all of these changes need to be driven by government, big companies, and international cooperation.

## 3. The best way for individuals to make an impact is to get involved politically and locally 

Personal actions like reducing your home’s emissions, driving an electric vehicle, and eating less meat are good places to start, and valuable because they send signals to a market ruled by supply and demand.

But most of our emissions come from larger systems that rule how we get and use energy on a daily basis. And replacing these systems requires political action, which is why getting involved in the political process is the best way for individuals to make an impact on the climate crisis.

Voters need to demand that elected officials adopt plans for climate change. Make your voice heard by doing the following:

1. **Make calls, write letters, and attend town halls:** Know where elected officials stand, ask them questions, and make clear that climate policies will help determine how you vote. Demand more funding for clean energy R&D, a clean energy standard, a price on carbon, incentives for cutting emissions, or other policies
2. **Look locally as well as nationally:** For example, in the United States, most electricity is regulated by statewide public utility commissions made up of either elected or
appointed commissioners. Find out who your representatives are and contact them
3. **Run for office:** You can probably have the most impact by running for state or local office

## 4. Emissions mostly come from five major activities
   Making things (cement, steel, plastic) 31%
   Plugging in (electricity) 27% 
   Growing things (plants, animals) 19% 
   Getting around (planes, trucks, cargo ships) 16% 
   Keeping warm and cool (heating, cooling, refrigeration) 7%

Using metal straws isn’t enough.

## 5. Planting trees doesn’t actually do much to help offset emissions
   If you do the math, you’d need to plant (and maintain) enough trees to cover roughly half the landmass of the world to offset just Americans’ emissions. 

Trees have aesthetic and environmental value, and we should be planting more of them, but there isn’t a practical way to plant enough of them to deal with the problems caused by burning fossil fuels. A more effective approach is to stop cutting down so many trees we already have. 
## 6. We need to aim for net zero emissions by 2050, instead of just reduced emissions by 2030
   And these goals have very different tracks. Making reductions by 2030 the wrong way might prevent us from ever getting to zero. 

We need to adopt policies that will put us on a path to deep decarbonization by 2050, not just fewer emissions by 2030. And if we’re going for the long-term goal it will take time to see improvements. 

## 7. Poor countries contribute to emissions the least, but are hit the hardest
   People and farmers in poorer countries need help adapting to climate change, particularly in agriculture. Agricultural research is chronically underfunded. Doubling CGIAR’s (Consortium of International Agricultural Research Centers) funding so it can reach more farmers is one of the main recommendations by the Global Commission on Adaptation.

## 8. Climate change is already very deadly and getting worse

Droughts, floods, rising temperatures, extreme weather events, etc. driven by global warming already devastate people and economies. 

By mid-century, increasing global temperatures are projected to raise global mortality rates by 14 deaths per 100,000. By the end of the century, if emissions growth stays high, climate change could be responsible for 75 extra deaths per 100,000 people. 

These statistics mean that by mid-century, climate change may be just as deadly as COVID-19, and by 2100 it may be five times as deadly. 
## In short
If you’re like me and you’ve read all the scary news about climate catastrophe but still don’t quite have a grasp on the big picture, this book is a great place to start. 

*How to Avoid a Climate Disaster* explains what the climate crisis is, what’s causing it, and what we need to do to stop it (or at least slow it down) — using clear and readable language.
