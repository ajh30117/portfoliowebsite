Checklists are used every day in a range of professions that allow little room for error, like  engineering, aviation, and even surgery. 


When the World Health Organization [introduced a checklist for medical professionals](https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=122226184) to use before, during, and after surgery, inpatient deaths following operations dropped by 40 percent, according to data published in the New England Journal of Medicine.


>Checklists are effective because they:
>1. **Remove reliance on memory** 
>2. **Create a repeatable, measurable process** 
>3. **Prevent distraction by listing objectives**
>4. **Build disicipline and good work habits** 


Below is an actionable checklist that can be referenced for technical writing projects. The checklist is inspired by [Google's Technical Writing Courses for Engineers](https://developers.google.com/tech-writing/one).
