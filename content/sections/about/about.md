I'm a Technical Writer for software with experience developing documentation and online content solutions for a wide range of products. I've worked full-time in cybersecurity software and clinical management software. And I've created documentation and content for over a dozen freelance clients like Contentstack, Green Security, and Tern Bicycles. 

As a writer, my goal is always to communicate complex information to people in a clear, concise, and reader-centric way. I draw from learning design, UX writing, and psychology to create high-quality content that empowers people to use products easily and with as little friction as possible. I also strive to create accessible content, and I'm certified in W3C's WCAG web accessibility fundamentals. 

Tools I use the most include docs-as-code tools, Microsoft Suite, DITA XML, Markdown, and Zendesk. I also have experience setting up static websites. I built this portfolio site using Gatsby and host it on Netlify.
