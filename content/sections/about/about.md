Since graduating with a BA in professional writing and rhetoric from the University of Tennessee, I've been developing my skills in technical writing, copywriting, and UX writing.

Words are powerful. They inform experience and drive action, and they need to be used precisely and purposefully to influence readers in the intended way. 

That's why my biggest focus, as a writer, is to write with fewer words â€” but more purpose.
