I'm a vision-driven Technical Writer for enterprise software with over three years of experience developing effective documentation and online content solutions for tech products. My specialties and interests include cybersecurity, structured authoring, docs-as-code, web accessibility, open source software, and learning design.

My goal as a technical writer is to communicate complex information to users in clear, concise, and digestible way. I incorporate ideas from learning design, UX writing, and psychology to deliver high-quality content solutions that empower users to consume information and use products with ease.

My portfolio contains a diverse range of writing samples including online help, user manuals, web copy, blog articles, and B2B marketing content.
