I graduated from the University of Tennessee with a BA in professional writing and rhetoric in 2020. Since then, I've been gaining experience and improving my skills in technical writing, B2B copywriting, and UX writing.

Words are powerful. They inform experiences and drive action, and they need to be used precisely and purposefully to influence readers in the intended way. 

As a writer, my style is minimalistic. I focus writing with fewer words, and more purpose.
