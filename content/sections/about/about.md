As a technical writer and copywriter for tech, my goal is always to communicate complex information simply and concisely, to a *human* audience. 

My portfolio contains a diverse range of writing samples including online help pages, user manuals, web copy, and long-form B2B marketing content.

My writing style is minimalistic. I focus on writing with fewer words, and more purpose. The results speak for themselves.

My current tech and learning interests are low-code/no-code solutions, static site generators, F/OSS, API documentation, and AI writing.
