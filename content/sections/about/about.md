I graduated in 2020 from the University of Tennessee with a BA in professional writing and rhetoric. Since then, I've been working as a technical writer and editor and B2B copywriter.

I like working with words because they're powerful. They inform experiences and drive action, and they need to be used precisely and purposefully to effectively influence readers to take that action. 

I'm a technical writer because it allows me to combine writing with my interest in tech and in generally learning about things (lately cybersecurity). I also find the intersection between communication and the digital world fascinating.

My writing style is minimalistic. (I'm passionate about *not* contributing to the morass of subpar listicles that plague today's internet). I focus on writing with fewer words, and more purpose. The results speak for themselves.
