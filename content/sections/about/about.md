I'm a technical writer focused on developing and leading documentation solutions for software companies. I previously worked full-time in cybersecurity software and clinical management software before transitioning to full-time contracting. I learned a lot working in large documentation/UX teams, but I also enjoy the creativity and problem-solving that comes with leading documentation projects independently.

My goal as a writer is to communicate complex information to people in a clear, concise, and reader-centric way. I study learning design, UX, and psychology to create high-quality writing that empowers people to process information and use technology with as little friction as possible. I also strive to create accessible content, and I'm certified in W3C's WCAG web accessibility fundamentals. 

Tools I use the most are docs-as-code tools, Microsoft Suite, DITA XML, Markdown, Read the Docs, and Zendesk. I'm also experienced with static site generators like Gatsby and Sphinx. I built this portfolio site using Gatsby, edit in VS Code, manage version control with Git, and host it on Netlify.
