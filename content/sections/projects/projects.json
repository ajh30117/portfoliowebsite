      "description": "This is a sample from one of the largest Online Help projects I've completed. Trend Micro integrated their existing Phish Insight product into their Vision One XDR platform as a new Phishing Simulation feature. To document the new Phishing Simulation feature, I first needed to understand the differences between the two products. Then I converted Phish Insight's sparse, outdated Knowledge Base articles into a set of comprehensive docs for Vision One's Online Help Center. Tools used include DITA XML, oXygen, and Git.",
