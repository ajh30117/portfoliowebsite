I sorted through pieces of existing FAQ content and interviewed developers and other SMEs to create categorized sets of updated, accurate, and user-friendly help articles that make it easy for hospital employees and vendors to find the answers they need in a central and searchable location.",

      "description": "The Phishing Simulation Assessment documentation is a large project I completed at Trend Micro. Trend's Phish Insight product was integrated as a new feature into the Vision One XDR SaaS platform. I converted the outdated Phish Insight knowledge base articles to Phishing Simulation online help articles for Trend Vision One, which required an intial cross-analysis between the two products and then adding and rewriting content. I wrote the Phishing Simulation Assessment topic and all child topics. Tools used include oXygen with DITA XML, Git/GitHub, and Umbraco.",

I regularly contribute to Awesome F/OSS, a site dedicated to exploring the best free and open source projects in the vast universe of open source software. We publish short and digestible articles on new free and open source projects weekly. For these articles, my writing style is concise and functional, but light. Reading about software can be boring. Our goal is to introduce an open source project in an engaging way and give readers a quick rundown on how the project could help them achieve their goals. Article sections include an introduction, As Described by AI, Features, and Getting Started. From there, readers can continue with their own research, jumpstarted by our guidance and plentiful links to external resources.",
